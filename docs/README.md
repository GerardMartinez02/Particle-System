## Particle System
### Description
A particle system is a collection of small images that, when viewed together, form a more complex object, such as fire, smoke, weather, or fireworks. Importantly, these complex effects are controlled by specifying the behavior of individual particles using properties such as initial position, velocity, and lifetime.

### Introduction
This research project has been developed by Gerard Martinez Garcia.

In this research the main objective where the following: 

- Do a research about Particle Systrems and his different implementations in videogame. 
- Be able to understand how Particle Systems are done and how we can create different types of particles taking into account their variables and characteristics.

### Market Study

Particle Systems are something that has been used practically since the beginning of the creation of games. Thus, being one of the most important things when creating the code of a video game. 

Here I will list a few examples of Particles implemented in videgames.
